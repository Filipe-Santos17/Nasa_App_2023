## ðŸ“± About the App

A wildfire is an uncontrolled fire that burns in wildland vegetation, forests, grasslands, savannas, and other ecosystems, and has been doing so for hundreds of millions of years.
To address this problem, NASA's Fire Information for Resource Management System (FIRMS) provides global active fire data, but with a three-hour delay after a satellite passes.
Our solution is to develop an application and a network of autonomous drones to enhance data collection, reduce delay, and display it to the user via mobile phone notification. This allows them to monitor and report fires through a user-friendly interface. The application will use data collected from satellites and from the autonomous drones, which will patrol the forest looking for fires and verify the accuracy of the report to seek up-to-date information.
